# MorseCodeTranslator
Translates Morse Code to English
Reads from code.txt which contains letters a-z and their respective Morse codes. These are stored in a HasMap.
As the user types, using spaces to denote letter changes and forwards slashes to denote word changes, a Text Node 
updates with the current translation. Future versions will add handling of unsupported characters and
English to Morse translation.
